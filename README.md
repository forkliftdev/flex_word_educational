FlexWord Educational
This project started because I’ve had an idea for a word game rattling around in my head for something like twenty five years. While digging into other word games for inspiration, I stumbled across a huge number of clones of a certain extremely popular game that I will politely avoid naming here. You probably know the one. It was eventually bought by the New York Times, and its core loop is simple enough that it became a go to project for people learning to code.

A lot of those clones ended up online. Some were taken down by the NYT for alleged copyright issues, but plenty are still out there. Either they slipped under the radar or they avoided the more obvious copyright problems, like using the original name.

The NYT version has stayed very strict about its format: one puzzle per day, five letter word, six guesses. Many of the clones experimented with different word lengths. I’ve seen everything from two letters all the way up to eleven. Two letter words feel a little silly, and anything past eight letters gets so obscure that it stops being fun for most people.

While reading through comments on one of the clones, I noticed something interesting. Teachers liked the three letter format, while though seasoned word-puzzle fans thought the three-letter game was 'wierd.' That got me thinking. Why not make a three letter game on purpose? It is a great way to practice game development. The word list is small enough to bundle right into the app; no back end needed. And since the target audience would be kids and teachers, I wouldn't want to collect any user data. That means, again, no back end required, which keeps things simple.

So that is how FlexWord Education came to be.






I'm gonna keep the following in case I want to review it.
